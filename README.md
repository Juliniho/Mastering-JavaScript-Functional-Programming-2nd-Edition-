**Write clean, robust, and maintainable web and server code using functional JavaScript**

## What is this book about?
Functional programming is a paradigm for developing software with better performance. It helps you write concise and testable code. To help you take your programming skills to the next level, this comprehensive book will assist you in harnessing the capabilities of functional programming with JavaScript and writing highly maintainable and testable web and server apps using functional JavaScript

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Simplify JavaScript coding using function composition, pipelining, chaining, and transducing
* Use declarative coding as opposed to imperative coding to write clean JavaScript code
* Create more reliable code with closures and immutable data
* Apply practical solutions to complex programming problems using recursion
* Improve your functional code using data types, type checking, and immutability

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
function newCounter() {
  let count = 0;
  return function() {
    count++;
    return count;
  };
}

const nc = newCounter();
console.log(nc()); // 1
console.log(nc()); // 2
console.log(nc()); // 3
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for JavaScript developers who want to enhance their programming skills and build efficient web applications. Frontend and backend developers who use various JavaScript frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, or Node.js will also find the book helpful. Working knowledge of ES2019 is required to grasp the concepts covered in the book easily.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-12).
